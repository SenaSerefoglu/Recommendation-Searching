# Recommendation-Searching
I have created a recommendation and searching system for my school site.
It is a simple system that uses a database to store the information of the words and their location.
The system takes an imput from user and gives recommendation of the words that are similar to the input.
Then it gives relevant class codes for selected words using k-means clustering and cosine similarity
